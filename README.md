# Analog-Clock
Creating an analog clock in Python using tkinter
A clock or watch is called “analog” when it has moving hands and (usually) hours
marked from number 1 to 12 to show you the time. Some have Roman Numerals
(I, II, III, etc) instead, or no numbers at all! In other words: not a digital clock.
Further Explanation: A clock, in general, has 12 numbers written on it, from 1 to
12, an hour hand, and a minute hand and somethings plus a second hand. Clock
angle problems relate to two different measurements: angles and time. The hourhand of a normal analog clock turns 360° in 12 hours (720 minutes) or 0.5° per
minute. The minute-hand rotates through 360° in 1 hour or 6° per minute. The
second-hand turns 360° in 1 minute (60 seconds) or 6° per second. They all run
around the center point in the clock face. Therefore, they can be imaged in the
same polar coordinate. Differently, they run clockwise, which should be taken into
consideration in code
